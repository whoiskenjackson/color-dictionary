#Color Dictionary

Color dictionary is a list (js or css) of color names, hex values, and rgb values. There is also a version available that has "Causes" with the list.

Currently there are 148 colors tied to names you can use in html / css. These colors are represented by 17 basic colors, 130 more shades, and [RebeccaPurple](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/). The names of these colors can be used instead of using hex or rgb values in CSS.

###Basic color keywords:

* aqua
* black
* blue
* fuchsia
* gray
* green
* lime
* maroon
* navy
* olive
* purple
* red
* silver
* teal
* white
* yellow

####Thank you to:

* [Tobias Wright](https://github.com/tobiaswright) - Supplied the list of "Causes" and colors they are associated with.
* [Andrew Mussey](https://github.com/amussey) - Wrote JS to quickly convert Hex Values to RGB Values.
